Vulcan TODO
===========

* Fixture with movie folder setup

* Edit metadata screen (read existing data, edit and save)
  * `date` input
* Function to load all metadata
  * load all at launch
  * have placeholder data in case user accesses movie list before all data is loaded (user will need to refresh screen)
  * have a URL that will refresh the data (if needed), rather than requiring server restart
